### How It Works
- **Symmetrical Design**: Draw a shape on one side of the horizontal axis, and the Shape Editor will automatically generate the mirrored counterpart on the opposite side.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Adjust points or modify the shape on one side, and the mirrored shape updates instantly, providing immediate visual feedback.

### Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Saves time in designing symmetrical shapes, making your workflow faster.
- **Creativity**: Facilitates experimentation with shapes, allowing for complex designs without manual adjustments.
- **Precision**: Ensures both sides of the shape are aligned and proportional, enhancing design quality.
- **User-Friendly**: Accessible for beginners while still being valuable for experienced developers.

## Dark Mode

- **Visual Comfort**: Reduces eye strain in low-light environments with a darker interface.
- **Aesthetic Appeal**: Offers a sleek, modern design that many users prefer.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Saves battery life on OLED screens by using less power for darker pixels.
- **User Preference**: Easily toggle between Light and Dark Modes to suit your environment or personal taste.

## Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files

### File Format
CSV files are plain text files where data is organized in a tabular format, with each value separated by a comma. For the Shape Editor, each line represents a point in the shape, formatted as:
```
x,y
```

### Usage
- **Saving Shapes**: Users can save drawn shapes as CSV files for easy storage and retrieval.
- **Loading Shapes**: The application can read CSV files to reconstruct shapes, facilitating project continuity.
- **Data Integration**: CSV format allows for easy integration with other applications or programming environments.

### Benefits
- **Simplicity**: Easy to read and write, making it user-friendly.
- **Compatibility**: Works with various applications, including spreadsheet software and programming languages.
- **Portability**: Easily shared and transferred between different systems.

## Getting Started
To begin using the Shape Editor, launch the application and start creating shapes. The generated code will be available for you to copy and use in your projects.
