## Features

- **Code Generation**: Automatically generates an array of points that represent the drawn shape, making it easy to incorporate into your codebase.
  
- **Copy and Paste Functionality**: Effortlessly copy the generated code from the code view and paste it into your preferred code editor for further development or modifications.

- **Immediate Feedback**: Experience quick testing and adjustments as you create shapes, enhancing your overall workflow.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies the process of integrating shape data into your projects, making it accessible for users of all skill levels.

- **Interactive Development**: Encourages a hands-on approach to shape creation and coding, allowing for greater creativity and experimentation.

- **File Access and Creation**: Open and save files in **plain text format** with a **.txt** extension, which contains comma-separated values representing the coordinates of the shapes.



## Point Mirroring

Easily create symmetrical shapes with the point mirroring feature, streamlining the design process.

### How Point Mirroring Works
- **Symmetrical Design**: You can draw a shape on one side of the horizontal axis, and the Shape Editor automatically generates the mirrored counterpart on the opposite side. This saves time and effort in manually creating symmetrical shapes.
- **Interactive Feedback**: As you adjust points or modify the shape on one side, the mirrored shape updates in real-time, providing immediate visual feedback.

#### Benefits of Point Mirroring
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the time needed to design symmetrical shapes, making the workflow faster and more efficient.
 
- **Creativity**: Encourages experimentation with shapes, as you can easily visualize and create complex designs without the hassle of manual adjustments.
 
- **Precision**: Ensures that both sides of the shape are perfectly aligned and proportional, enhancing the overall quality of the design.
 
- **User-Friendly**: Simplifies the design process for users of all skill levels, making it accessible to beginners while still being useful for experienced developers.

Point mirroring in the Shape Editor is a powerful feature that streamlines the process of creating symmetrical shapes, allowing you to focus on creativity and design rather than tedious adjustments. This functionality not only enhances your experience but also improves the overall efficiency of shape creation.

- **Visual Comfort**: Dark Mode reduces eye strain by using darker colors for the interface, making it easier to work for extended periods without discomfort.

- **Aesthetic Appeal**: The sleek, modern design of Dark Mode provides a visually appealing alternative that you may prefer for its contemporary look.

- **Energy Efficiency**: For devices with OLED screens, Dark Mode can help save battery life by using less power when displaying darker pixels.

- **User Preference**: You can easily toggle between Light and Dark Modes, allowing you to choose your preferred interface based on your environment or personal taste.

- **Consistent Experience**: The transition to Dark Mode maintains consistency across all elements of the Shape Editor, ensuring that all features and functionalities remain easily accessible and visually coherent.

To enable Dark Mode, you simply need to check the box for the Dark Mode option, instantly transforming the interface to suit your preferences. This feature not only enhances usability but also aligns with modern design trends.

To begin using the Shape Editor, simply launch the application and start creating shapes. The generated code will be available for you to copy and use in your projects.

















### Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files in Shape Editor

 **File Format**:
   - CSV files are plain text files where data is organized in a tabular format, with each value separated by a comma.
   - For the Shape Editor, each line in the CSV file represents a point in the shape, formatted as:



    41,0
    41,0
    -18,-24
    -18,24
    -40,-20
    -40,20
    -19,0
    -19,0


 **Usage**:
   - **Saving Shapes**: Users can save their drawn shapes as CSV files, allowing easy storage and retrieval of shape data.
   - **Loading Shapes**: The application can read CSV files to reconstruct shapes, making it convenient for users to work on projects across sessions.
   - **Data Integration**: CSV format allows for easy integration with other applications or programming environments, facilitating further processing or analysis of shape data.

 **Benefits**:
   - **Simplicity**: The CSV format is easy to read and write, making it user-friendly.
   - **Compatibility**: Many applications, including spreadsheet software and programming languages, can easily handle CSV files.
   - **Portability**: CSV files can be easily shared and transferred between different systems and platforms.

This structure makes it efficient for users to manage and manipulate shape data within the Shape Editor and beyond.
