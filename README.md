# Shape Editor

 Shape Editor allows you to draw shapes interactively in the draw area. 
 While an array of points is visualized and displayed in the code view. This allows users to see the coordinates of the points that define the shape they are creating.

Key functionalities include point selection, shape scaling, and shape mirroring.


# Benefits of Visualization

**Immediate Feedback**: Users can see the exact points being used to form the shape, which aids in understanding the shape's structure.

**Debugging and Adjustment**: If you want to adjust points, you can easily identify their coordinates and modify them as needed.

The visualization of the array of points as VB.NET code in the TextBox enhances user interaction with the Shape Editor application, providing clarity and control over the shapes being created.
